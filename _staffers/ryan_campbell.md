    Hi! Iâ€™m Ryan, a senior studying mathematics and computer science from the Bay Area. I am interested in studying emergent properties found in LLMs, as well as deep reinforcement learning applied to robotics. My current research focuses on using DRL to automate a tracked robot vacuum system. Some of my hobbies include hiking, basketball, skateboarding, and playing music.
office-hours: Tuesday, 11am - 12pm (Location TBD).
