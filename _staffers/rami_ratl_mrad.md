about-me: |
    Hi, I’m a rising senior studying EECS with an interest in natural and artificial intelligence research. I’ve been conducting research in this field for some time at Stanford’s neuroscience institute and had the chance to spend some time exploring other research areas in neuroscience at Harvard as well. In my free time, I’m a manager for Cal’s basketball team and enjoy spending time playing basketball. If you have any questions relating to research or basketball feel free to reach out!
office-hours: Friday, 12pm - 1pm. Warren Hall 101-B (Region A)
