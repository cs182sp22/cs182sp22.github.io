about-me: I did my undergrad at UC Berkeley in computer science (2011), then did a Master's at UCLA (2016) focusing in ML/AI and computer vision. I currently work at Pinterest on the Visual Search team as a machine learning engineer, working on the entire ML stack including modeling, serving, and big-data pipelines. I recently moved to Fullerton, CA and am loving it! For fun, I enjoy playing music (piano, guitar, bass, vocals), video games, and pickleball.
