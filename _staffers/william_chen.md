about-me: |
    I'm a second-year CS PhD student advised by Prof. Sergey Levine. Previously, I did my undergrad and Master's at MIT, where I researched the use of language models for robot semantic scene understanding and TAed classes on robotics and natural language processing. My research is on the intersection of language, decision making, and making cool robots do cool things. In my free time, I enjoy playing games, archery, and making funky lil crochet animals.
office-hours: Thursday, 11am - 12pm. Warren Hall 101-B (Region A)
